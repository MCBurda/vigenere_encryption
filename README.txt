This small program in C is meant to encrypt a word given at runtime with the Vigenere cipher.

The Vigenere cipher encrypts the plaintext input by shifting the letters of the plaintext one after the other by the letters of a key(word) input by the user.

If the key is shorter than the plaintext, the first letter of the key is used again to encrypt the next character in the plaintext. In other words, the program loops through the key, till the entire plaintext is encrypted.
